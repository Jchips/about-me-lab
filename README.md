### Reflections and Comments

- This assignment went fine. It was a little challenging.
- My for loops weren't working right for a bit but I figure them out. I also figured out I had to use return statements to calculate the amount of correct answers while using functions.
- The assignment took me 4-5hrs maybe which is I guess about how long I expected it to take.
