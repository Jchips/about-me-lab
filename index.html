    <h2>Bio</h2>
    <p>Just a short, sad, Black woman who likes music, coding and dance.</p>
    <p>I currently live in Washington, US, although I was born in Texas. I am 22yrs 
      old and was working towards getting a bachelor's degree in software 
      development at UT Dallas before I stopped to do Code Fellows.
      Before UT Dallas, I was at the University of Washington and then Washington 
      State University, but I moved to Dallas to be closer to family that I have 
      there. My goal is to become either a full stack web developer or a mobile 
      developer. So far I have had some coding experience in Java, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, 
      Kotlin, PHP, SQL, R, and Python, and I have worked with Node.js, jQuery and Vue.js 
      (but don't expect a lot out of me because I have forgotten a lot of what I learned).
      I have never had a career before, just a few jobs that have nothing to do with coding.
      I also love dance and watching TV shows, and I'm a huge phone geek. 
      I love Zendaya and see her as a great role model...and I have a stuffed cow 
      named "Tipsy" üêÆ.</p>
