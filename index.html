    <h2>Bio</h2>
    <p>Just a short, awkward Black woman who likes music, coding and dance.</p>
    <p>I currently live in Washington, USA where I grew up, although I was born in 
      Texas. I am 22yrs old and was working towards getting a bachelor's degree 
      in software development at UT Dallas before I stopped to do Code Fellows.
      Before UT Dallas, I was at the University of Washington and then Washington 
      State University, but I moved to Dallas to be closer to family that I have 
      there. My goal is to become either a full stack web developer or a mobile 
      developer. So far I have had some coding experience in Java, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, 
      SASS/SCSS, Kotlin, PHP, SQL, R, and Python, and I have worked with Node.js, jQuery 
      and Vue.js (but don't expect a lot out of me because I have forgotten a lot of what 
      I learned). I have never had a career before, just a few jobs that have nothing to 
      do with coding. I also love dance and watching TV shows, and I'm a huge phone geek. 
      I love Zendaya and see her as a great role model...and I have a stuffed cow 
      named "Tipsy" üêÆ.</p>
